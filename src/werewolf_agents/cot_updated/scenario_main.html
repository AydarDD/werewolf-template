Hello players, night has started. Please go to sleep.
moderator: Day start:

Hello players, Good Morning. Please wake up.

Villager dead: Alas! A villager player has been eliminated by the wolves. His name is 'Haruto'.

Let me ask one by one about who are the wolves among ourselves.
moderator: Hey Helga, who do you think is or is not a 'wolf' in the group and what is your reason?
Alice: I think Bob is acting suspicious.
Fred: text='"Considering the initial discussion and the mention of \'Bob\' acting suspicious, which I\'m assuming refers to Michael, and in the absence of concrete evidence, I\'m voting to eliminate Michael, but I\'m open to changing my mind as more information becomes available."'
moderator: It's time to vote. Who do you think is the werewolf?
Fred: text='"I\'m voting to eliminate Michael, as the initial mention of suspicious behavior by Alice, although potentially incorrect due to the mix-up with \'Bob\', still warrants further investigation, and in the absence of any concrete evidence to clear his name or any other player providing a more convincing argument for an alternative suspect, I believe it\'s the best course of action at this point in the game."'

moderator: Wolf night:

Hello wolves, I have created this new private group between wolves called "wolfs-group".

I will use this group to ask you to vote a player to eliminate every night.

Here are the alive villager players for this night: ['Chagent', 'Michael', 'Helga', 'Ling', 'Haruto', 'Jian']
WolfAlice: Who should we eliminate tonight?
Fred: text="I'm going to stick with Jian as my final suggestion for target, and I think we should all be on the same page to ensure a successful elimination."
